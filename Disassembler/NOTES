Improvements to 6502 disassembly:
- nes reads prg rom start points from 6 last bytes
	- $FFFA-$FFFB - non-maskable interrupt*(??)
	- $FFFC-$FFFD - reset vector (actual start point)
	- $FFFE-$FFFF - interrupt request / break** (??)
- mark all bytes as data (.db)
- create tree-like structure, nodes are blocks from label to label/data
- start disassebling opcodes from these locations, watch for instructions:
	- JMP - if not already marked, mark destination and continue marking from there (insert new child)
	- BEQ/BPL/.../JSR - same as above except, we come back to next instruction after that one
	- RTS/RTI - end of code block

TODO:
  - Determine which adjacient vertices in labeled
